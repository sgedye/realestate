    "subtitle": "Green setting, great entry opportunity",
    "description": "Tucked away down Holland Street, this two-storey home is in prime position in a small\ngroup of townhouses, offering a sense of character and a leafy setting that sets it apart from the ordinary. Rough white render, arched entries, terracotta, timber, and bright white interiors create a retro Spanish feel that really works right now, with a great layout and lovely green outlooks. It's ideal for a couple or single looking for just the right place to really make your own, and a real opportunity to secure a central location on the Subiaco border. When you want to head out for a drink, La Casetta wine-bar is literally your neighbour or you can take a short walk and grab an amazing pizza from Monsterella or dine at the numerous local cafes and restaurants.\n\nJacarandas and gumtrees line Holland Street, and a terracotta-coloured gate in a high white wall leads to the secluded courtyard of the townhouse. Vehicle entry is at the rear off Adkins Lane, where a garden pathway leads to the home's wide arched portico. Inside, a series of tall timber windows frame the green outlook, and natural terracotta floors flow in the air-conditioned open-plan space: living, dining, and neat white kitchen. The laundry is also on this level, opening to the spacious courtyard on the Holland Street side. An open hardwood stair is among the timber touches that add warmth to the interiors, leading up to the powder room on the landing. On the upper level are the bathroom and three carpeted bedrooms. Two have leafy views over the common garden, including the main bedroom with air-conditioning, and the third bedroom or ideal study looks down to the courtyard.\n\nAll the fundamentals are here: thoughtful layout, touches of warmth and individuality in the architecture, green setting, and seclusion away from Cambridge Street while enjoying all the advantages of a hub close to the city. You also have the exciting possibility to add value and put your own design spirit into the place, should you choose to do some kitchen and bathroom updates sometime in the future. Close to Lake Monger, Perry Lakes, and all kinds of shopping and restaurants, with Subiaco and West Leederville down the road, the location never goes out of style.\n\n• Two-storey townhouse, secluded down Holland Street\n• Garden setting, white rendered exterior, arches\n• Green outlooks through timber-framed windows\n• Terracotta floors, timber stair, white interiors\n• Air-conditioned open-plan, separate powder room\n• 3 carpeted bedrooms, or one as study\n• Bathroom with bath, main bedroom air-conditioned\n• Carport at rear off Adkins Lane\n• Great location on Subiaco border\n• Close to shopping, Lake Monger, sporting fields, restaurants\n\nCouncil Rates: $1,317.63 per annum (Approx.)\nWater Rates: $1,115.89 per annum (Approx.)\nStrata Rates: $884.00 per quarter (Approx.)\n\nPlease call John Howell on 0499 773 075 for further detail",
