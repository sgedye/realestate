    "description": "Nestled right in the heart of Leederville yet tranquilly towards the rear of a securely-gated boutique complex, this impressive 3 bedroom 2 bathroom standalone townhouse is arguably the pick of the bunch and has no common walls, is set very far back from the street and has a practical floor plan that will suit the personal needs of many.\n\nIts central Oxford Street location is the highlight here though, allowing you to grab many a morning coffee at Oxford Yard across the road whilst embracing the easy walking distance to other trendy cafes, restaurants, bars and more along the buzzing local entertainment strip.\n\nBeyond remote-controlled access gates, you will find a comfortable open-plan living, dining and kitchen area on the ground level – split-system air-conditioning, gas-bayonet heating, space for a study nook and all. It even boasts direct access out to a delightful patio-entertaining area with low-maintenance reticulated gardens and a side-access gate at the back of the residence that doubles as an alternative entry point.\n\nThe kitchen itself comes well-equipped with a breakfast bar, tiled splashbacks, an integrated range hood, a Fisher and Paykel gas cooktop, a separate oven of the same brand, an integrated Westinghouse microwave and a stainless-steel dishwasher for good measure. Upstairs, a huge master suite headlines the carpeted bedrooms (all of which have full-height mirrored built-in wardrobes) and allows you to wake up to a pleasant leafy aspect, alongside an intimate ensuite bathroom with a shower, toilet and vanity.\n\nIt really is a case of \"position perfect\" here, with public transport, schools, shopping, the freeway, the sprawling Leederville Oval, community sporting and recreational facilities, Leederville Train Station, the freeway and beautiful Lake Monger all nearby and very much within arm's reach. Time to get that step count up, once and for all!\n\nCouncil Rates = $2148.19 per year\nWater Rates = $1354.58 per year\nStrata Rates = $858.38 per quarter\nStrata Reserve Fund = $236.25 per quarter",
