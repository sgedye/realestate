Right here. No seriously, stop reading. Just book the viewing. In fact, it's so lovely that we reckon you might not ever want to move out. Cosied in amongst lush gardens and with more space than an apartment, it's perfect if you love having a connection with actual nature rather than the concrete jungle of the city. But it's more than a pretty face. Storage is essential in homes like this, so the built-in robes, linen cupboard, and kitchen cabinets may be the most practical features here. Then again, the open plan living and dining area is quite the delight too. Reverse cycle aircon keeps you comfy and the light, bright palette means you can bring your furnishings without worrying if they'll match the colour scheme. The sliding door here leads out to the surprisingly spacious yard with its lush lawn and entertaining area - pretty perfect for hosting friends or just sitting and revelling in the fact you own this stunning home.\n\nLocation-wise, this is *the* sweet spot between Mt Lawley and Inglewood. A short stroll gets you to Beaufort Street where you can hop on the bus and commute to the city (3.2km), catch up with mates at Testun (230m), or pick up some groceries at IGA (290m). With cafes such as Local and Aesthetic (350m) and Secondeli (250m) you're spoilt for good coffee and good food so we'll let you do the hard work of choosing your most beloved spot. Behind your townhouse is Copley Park where you can wander or relax, and – bonus – even when you're not there you get gorgeous views of it from both bedroom windows. Isn't this just the most darling property? Go ahead and treat yourself.\n\nReady for style as well as substance?\n\nHit Natalie up now (call or email).

    "description": "Nestled right in the heart of Leederville yet tranquilly towards the rear of a securely-gated boutique complex, this impressive 3 bedroom 2 bathroom standalone townhouse is arguably the pick of the bunch and has no common walls, is set very far back from the street and has a practical floor plan that will suit the personal needs of many.\n\nIts central Oxford Street location is the highlight here though, allowing you to grab many a morning coffee at Oxford Yard across the road whilst embracing the easy walking distance to other trendy cafes, restaurants, bars and more along the buzzing local entertainment strip.\n\nBeyond remote-controlled access gates, you will find a comfortable open-plan living, dining and kitchen area on the ground level – split-system air-conditioning, gas-bayonet heating, space for a study nook and all. It even boasts direct access out to a delightful patio-entertaining area with low-maintenance reticulated gardens and a side-access gate at the back of the residence that doubles as an alternative entry point.\n\nThe kitchen itself comes well-equipped with a breakfast bar, tiled splashbacks, an integrated range hood, a Fisher and Paykel gas cooktop, a separate oven of the same brand, an integrated Westinghouse microwave and a stainless-steel dishwasher for good measure. Upstairs, a huge master suite headlines the carpeted bedrooms (all of which have full-height mirrored built-in wardrobes) and allows you to wake up to a pleasant leafy aspect, alongside an intimate ensuite bathroom with a shower, toilet and vanity.\n\nIt really is a case of \"position perfect\" here, with public transport, schools, shopping, the freeway, the sprawling Leederville Oval, community sporting and recreational facilities, Leederville Train Station, the freeway and beautiful Lake Monger all nearby and very much within arm's reach. Time to get that step count up, once and for all!\n\nCouncil Rates = $2148.19 per year\nWater Rates = $1354.58 per year\nStrata Rates = $858.38 per quarter\nStrata Reserve Fund = $236.25 per quarter",
