    "description": "This cleverly designed 3 bed, 3 level town house is indeed right amongst the action, but you could be forgiven for thinking you are in the leafy suburbs. The area is special, so if you like an exciting lifestyle, but yearn for home to be a sanctuary, this one's for you. \n\nSpacious throughout and with a delightful presentation the sleek architecture is enhanced by a palette of soft 'cafe au lait' tones, and there is a strong accent on the functional without distraction from the beauty. The ground floor is all about living with an open plan design incorporating a well planned kitchen and access to a courtyard garden. The first floor contains 2 of the 3 bedrooms and a sleek family bathroom, plus a great balcony, while the 'loft-style' top floor is home to a 3rd bedroom which could easily be a home-office or den. \n\nThis location gives you the opportunity to really explore our capital city by road, rail or on foot. Close by are parks schools and cafes, sporting facilities are at hand, whether it's NRL or AFL, Art, Cultural events culinary delights are all yours for the taking. Life's pretty good isn't it. \n\nCOMPRISING\n\n– 3 bedrooms \n– 1 bathroom\n– Light open-plan living\n– Well planned kitchen \n– Double garage (tandem)\n\n\nFeatures include;\n– Dishwasher\n– Split system A/C\n– Freshly painted \n– Wide balcony\n– Rear courtyard / alfresco\n– Downstairs WC\n\nWater rates $1481.50 approx.
