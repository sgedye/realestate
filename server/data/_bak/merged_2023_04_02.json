    ],
    "description": "Shaun Pratt of Bellcourt. is pleased to present to you this beautiful street-front townhouse in the sought after avenues of Mount Lawley.\n\nFeaturing a supersized and private courtyard, garden soirées will definitely become part of your new lifestyle. Not only will you love it, but so will your friends and family! The courtyard is enchanting, surrounded by mature trees and greenery backlit by beautiful lighting with plenty of room for entertaining or relaxation.\n\nBeing street-front, this townhouse feels like its own independent home where you don't notice the neighbours, with the outlook from every window facing greenery. In addition to the privacy bonus, a great feature of this property is that there is the possibility of parking up to 3 cars in tandem. One in the carport and the others in the driveway.\n\nHeading inside, the ground level features the open-plan living space which seamlessly connects with outdoors. The kitchen features stainless steel appliances, overhead cupboards and surrounding bench allowing for bar stools. Next to the kitchen is the large laundry, which can easily operate as an extension to the kitchen, much like a scullery. There is also a downstairs powder room for guests.\n\nUpstairs has the two bedrooms and bathroom. The main bedroom is a great size and has built-in-robes, with lovely tree-top outlook through the windows. The bathroom is neat and tidy with beautiful retro blue floor tiles (which I personally love!).\n\nThis is a perfect first or second home, downsizer or investment property! \n\nIn close proximity to everything that Mount Lawley has to offer such as fantastic cafes, restaurants, bars, shops and schools. Only a short distance to public transport, including Mount Lawley Train Station - heading into the CBD will be an absolute breeze!\n\nFor further information please contact Shaun of Bellcourt. Mount Lawley on 0466 822 050 or via shaun@bellcourtproperty.com.au\n\nStrata Fees: $412.50 (Admin) + $58.75 (Reserve) P/Q approx.",
