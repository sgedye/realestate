    "description": "Tucked away down Holland Street, this two-storey home is in prime position in a small\ngroup of townhouses, offering a sense of character and a leafy setting that sets it apart from the ordinary. Rough white render, arched entries, terracotta, timber, and bright white interiors create a retro Spanish feel that really works right now, with a great layout and lovely green outlooks. It's ideal for a couple or single looking for just the right place to really make your own, and a real opportunity to secure a central location on the Subiaco border. When you want to head out for a drink, La Casetta wine-bar is literally your neighbour or you can take a short walk and grab an amazing pizza from Monsterella or dine at the numerous local cafes and restaurants.\nJacarandas and gumtrees line Holland Street, and a terracotta-coloured gate in a high white wall leads to the secluded courtyard of the townhouse. Vehicle entry is at the rear off Adkins Lane, where a garden pathway leads to the home's wide arched portico. Inside, a series of tall timber windows frame the green outlook, and natural terracotta floors flow in the air-conditioned open-plan space: living, dining, and neat white kitchen. The laundry is also on this level, opening to the spacious courtyard on the Holland Street side.
